# Phase 1: Modest problems.

# duos

# Write a method duos that accepts a string as an argument and returns the count of the number of times 
# the same character appears consecutively in the given string.

# p duos('dinosaurs')     # 0
# p duos('e')             # 0


# sentence_swap

# Write a method sentence_swap that accepts a sentence and a hash as arguments. 
# The method should return a new sentence where every word is replaced with it's 
# corresponding value in the hash. If a word does not exist as a key of the hash, 
# then it should remain unchanged.

# hash_mapped

# Write a method hash_mapped that accepts a hash, a proc, and a block. 
# The method should return a new hash where each key is the result of the original

# Write a method counted_characters that accepts a string as an argument. 
# The method should return an array containing the characters of the string

# triplet_true?

# Write a method triplet_true? that accepts a string as an argument and returns a boolean indicating

# energetic_encoding

# Write a method energetic_encoding that accepts a string and a hash as arguments. 
# The method should return a new string where characters of the original string are 
# replaced with the corresponding values in the hash. If a character is not a key of the hash,

# Write a method uncompress that accepts a string as an argument. 
# The string will be formatted so every letter is followed by a number.
